# Lag-Lead-Compensator-Analysis-with-Matlab
This system has Loop Gain (L(s)) = G(s)*H(s) = 𝐾/((s)(s+2)(s+10)) with
Gain Crossover Freq. (Wgc) = 4 rad/s;
Phase Margin (PM) = 50 deg;
Kv = 100;

You can modify the system specification by recalculate and make some changes on Matlab source code.
Thank you, have fun!
